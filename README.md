# SQL Mastery: From Zero to Hero 📊

Welcome to my SQL learning repository! This project documents my journey through the **30-Hour SQL Full Course** by **Data with Baraa**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Course Resource:** [SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus)

## 📂 Learning Progress

### ✅ Phase 1-3: Foundations, DDL/DML & Filtering
* Basic querying, Table structures (DDL), Data manipulation (DML).
* Advanced filtering using Logical Operators and Pattern Matching.

### ✅ Phase 4: Mastering Joins (Chapter 6 - Part 1)
*Completed: Learned how to combine data from multiple tables using relational logic.*

**Types of Joins Covered:**
* **Inner Join:** Fetching matching records from both tables.
* **Left Join:** Keeping all records from the left table and matching from the right.
* **Right Join:** Keeping all records from the right table and matching from the left.
* **Full Join:** Combining all records from both tables (Union of datasets).

**Advanced Anti-Joins (Data Auditing):**
* **Left Anti Join:** Identifying records present *only* in the left table (where no match exists on the right).
* **Right Anti Join:** Identifying records present *only* in the right table.
* **Full Anti Join:** Finding all non-matching records from both sides.
